# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to PlaceRepository! Your contributions help provide an open system for accessing all place data.

## Guidelines

- Places that have data hosted elsewhere should not be added to PlaceRepository.
- All property keys should attempt to conform to frequently used OpenStreetMap tags.
- `ref` property keys should exist on every feature. The values of `ref` should begin with `placerepository_{{BRAND_NAME}}:` followed by a unique number, and the `{{BRAND_NAME}}` text should be replaced with the file name.
